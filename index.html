    <h3>The Best Work of My 8th Grade Year</h3>
    <h2>My SMART Goal: To Procrastinate Less</h2>
    <h5>At the start of this year, I aimed to procrastinate as little as possible. To try and achieve this goal, I tried to do harder assignments as early as possible, and to do my homework whenever I had free time. For the rest of the year, I will modify my goal to make it so that I do not leave over half of my annotations for Wednesday night.</h5>
    <h4>My Strength and Stretch</h4>
    <h5>My Strength that I brought to 8th grade was working under strict time constraints. I tend top be able to work well and stay calm under tight time constraints. I have used this on essays that I had to complete in 1 or 2 class periods. </h5>
    <h5>My Stretch that I brought to 8th grade was asking questions in class. I find asking or answering questions in class to be a stretch, because I am usually too busy taking notes, or can't think of anything to say. I feel this is still a stretch, but I have been able to ask more questions in my classes. </h5>
