    <h3>My Mid-Year Reflection</h3>
    <h4>How broad is your friend group? Are peers easily accepted? What have you done/plan to do to improve the social atmosphere within your group of friends, grade-level, or school?</h4>
    <h5>My friend group is fairly broad, and new people are accepted somewhat easily. I think I could try to make my friend group more open to everyone.</h5>
    <h4>How have you contributed to our community this year? Provide examples of any leadership roles you have assumed or how you have been a role model. How have you grown as a leader/role model, or what are some ideas on how to assume these roles in the future?</h4>
    <h5>This year, being at the highest grade in the school, I had to be a role model for many of the younger students, as well as my kindergarden buddies. I think in the future I should work harder to attain leadership roles in my community.</h5>
    <h4>Are you consistent with completing work on time? What is hindering/helping you?</h4>
    <h5>I am somewhat consistent on turning in my homework, but sometimes I can forget to bring my assignments to school or forget to turn them in. My natural inclination to procrastinate is hindering me, while my ability to work quickly helps me.</h5>
